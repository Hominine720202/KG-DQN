            abstract = "Text-based adventure games provide a platform on which to explore reinforcement learning in the context of a combinatorial action space, such as natural language. We present a deep reinforcement learning architecture that represents the game state as a knowledge graph which is learned during exploration. This graph is used to prune the action space, enabling more efficient exploration. The question of which action to take can be reduced to a question-answering task, a form of transfer learning that pre-trains certain parts of our architecture. In experiments using the TextWorld framework, we show that our proposed technique can learn a control policy faster than baseline alternatives. We have also open-sourced our code at https://github.com/rajammanabrolu/KG-DQN.",

Disclaimer: Code is not upkept

## Data/Pre-training
 - Games are created using [Textworld's](https://github.com/Microsoft/TextWorld) `tw-make` as specified in the paper.
 - Pre-training is done using [DrQA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DrQA) by generating traces using the WalkthroughAgent in Textworld.
	 - These traces consist of pairs of (observation, action) pairs which are then used to train DrQA by asking the question of "What action do I take?"
 

## Running the code
- Code is run using an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux "Anaconda 2") environment for Python 3.6. The environment is defined in **env.yml**. Run `conda env create -f env.yml` and then `source activate kgdqn` to enter the correct environment.
- Baseline BOW-DQN implementation is in `dqn/`
- KG-DQN implementation is in `kgdqn/`, 
- For both games, run using `python train.py` after defining the required parameters and game in `train.py`
- `w2id.txt` and `id2act.txt` are required and are the dictionaries for the vocab and full action set for the specific game
	- `w2id`is the vocabulary and can be extracted from the ,z8 game file that is given by `tw-make` using `tw-extract`
	- id2act can also be generated by using a union of all [admissible actions](https://textworld.readthedocs.io/en/latest/textworld.envs.glulx.html#textworld.envs.glulx.git_glulx_ml.GlulxGameState.admissible_commands) found using the both the walkthrough agent and random agent to explore the world.
- Similarly, `entity2id.txt`/`relation2id.txt` defines the entities and relations that can be extracted by OpenIE for the game in a dictionary format 
	- These are also extracted by running both the walkthrough agents and random agents with just the triple extraction process found in `representations.py` and enumerating all entities and relations found. Entities and relations not in these files at test time are ignored.
